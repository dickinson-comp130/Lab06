    "There are two __Lab Exams__ in this course.  They are intended to complement the written exams by providing the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the content using a complementary set of skills.  While written tests focus more on conceptual mastery, lab exams focus on the application of that mastery to problem solving using programming in the Python language.\n",

These exams will be open to all materials including the textbook, notes, prior activities, exercises and lab assignments, and static web resources (i.e. no human interaction via chat or messaging). Lab exams will be distributed electronically at the beginning of the lab period and must be submitted electronically by the end of the lab period.\n",

It is given prior to the first *real* lab exam to help your understand the process, level of independence and go gage your preparedness for the the actual lab exam the following week."
